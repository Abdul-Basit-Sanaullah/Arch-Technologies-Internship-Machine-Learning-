# Machine Learning Internship Tasks

This repository contains two machine learning projects that I completed as part of my internship.  
Both tasks focus on building classification models using real datasets.

# Task 1: Email Spam Classification

In this task, I built a model to classify emails as spam or not spam.

# What I did:
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Cleaned the data (removed duplicates)
- Preprocessed the text (lowercase, removed punctuation, stopwords, etc.)
- Converted text into numerical features using CountVectorizer
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Trained a Naive Bayes model
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and other metrics

# Result:
The model achieved around **97% accuracy** on the test data.

This task helped me understand text preprocessing, feature extraction, and supervised classification.

# Task 2: MNIST Digit Recognition

In this task, I built a model to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset.

# What I did:
- Loaded and visualized the MNIST dataset (28×28 images)
- Normalized pixel values
- Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Trained the model for multiple epochs
- Evaluated the model on test data

# Result:
The model achieved around **98% test accuracy**.

This task helped me understand image preprocessing and how CNNs work for image classification.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

These projects demonstrate my understanding of supervised learning, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
